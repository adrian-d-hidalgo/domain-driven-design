# Appendix A: Strategic Classification Framework

This appendix provides a detailed framework for classifying subdomains and making investment decisions. We use an **e-commerce platform** as the reference example throughout.

## Strategic Classification Overview

| Type | Investment | Strategy | Purpose & Guidance |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Core** | 60-70% | Custom-built, best team, full DDD & tests | Encodes unique business advantage. High change rate, tight quality bar, explicit boundaries, event-driven where useful. |
| **Supporting** | 20-30% | Build in-house (templates ok), modular & reliable | Enables Core to operate. Has business semantics but doesn't differentiate on its own. Focus on stability, clear contracts, and integration. |
| **Generic** | 5-10% | Buy/SaaS/OSS, minimal customization | Commodity capabilities. Prefer managed services or libraries; keep adapters thin and swappable. |

## Core Subdomain (60-70% investment)

**Definition:** The strategic heart‚Äîwhat makes your e-commerce platform unique and competitive.

### Investment Philosophy

> "Put the best people on the Core Domain." ‚Äî Evans (2003)

### Characteristics

- ‚úÖ Business differentiator (competitive advantage)
- ‚úÖ Complex, frequently-changing business rules
- ‚úÖ Proprietary knowledge and algorithms
- ‚úÖ Primary revenue generator
- ‚úÖ No adequate third-party solution exists

### Team & Quality

- Best talent (senior developers + domain experts)
- Highest quality standards (90%+ test coverage)
- Full DDD tactical patterns (Aggregates, Events, etc.)
- Continuous innovation and iteration
- Event-driven architecture where beneficial
- Strategic IP protection

### E-Commerce Core Examples

| Subdomain | Module Path | Why It's Core | Key Capabilities |
|-----------|------------|---------------|------------------|

- [ ] No adequate third-party solution
- [ ] Customers notice and value it

## Supporting Subdomain (20-30% investment)

**Definition:** Necessary for operations but not a competitive differentiator. Enables Core to function.

### Characteristics

- ‚öôÔ∏è Business necessity (Core can't work without it)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Medium complexity with business-specific logic
- ‚öôÔ∏è Stable requirements (changes quarterly/yearly)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Some customization needed, but templates work
- ‚öôÔ∏è "Build vs Buy" is debatable

### Team & Quality

- Competent mid-level developers
- Good engineering quality (70-80% test coverage)
- Modular, well-documented, reliable
- Clear contracts and integration points
- Focus on stability over innovation

### E-Commerce Supporting Examples

| Subdomain | Module Path | Why It's Supporting | Key Capabilities |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Account Management** | `account/` | Standard but with business rules | User profiles, organization/tenancy, role hierarchy, account settings |
| **Order Management** | `order/` | Core workflows but standard patterns | Order creation, status tracking, cancellation, refund processing |
| **Catalog Management** | `catalog/` | Product data with business semantics | Product CRUD, categories, attributes, variants, SKU management |
| **Permissions** | `permissions/` | RBAC/ABAC with custom rules | Role management, permission policies, resource-based access control |
| **Billing** | `billing/` | Subscription/quota logic | Plan management, usage tracking, invoicing, payment scheduling |
| **Notification** | `notification/` | Multi-channel orchestration | Template management, channel selection, delivery scheduling, preferences |
| **Shipping** | `shipping/` | Carrier integration + business rules | Rate calculation, label generation, tracking, return management |
| **Promotion** | `promotion/` | Discount rules engine | Coupon management, rule evaluation, eligibility checking, redemption tracking |
| **Review System** | `review/` | Rating + moderation workflow | Review submission, moderation queue, verified purchase badges, aggregation |
| **Wishlist** | `wishlist/` | User collections + sharing | List management, item tracking, privacy controls, social sharing |

### Decision Criteria: Supporting if

- [ ] Necessary for business operations
- [ ] Has some business-specific logic
- [ ] Not a competitive differentiator
- [ ] Could build or buy, but building gives more control
- [ ] Integrates deeply with Core

## Generic Subdomain (5-10% investment)

**Definition:** Commodity solutions available off-the-shelf. Zero competitive differentiation.

### Characteristics

- üì¶ Standardized, solved problems
- üì¶ Buy, use SaaS, or adopt open-source
- üì¶ Minimal or no customization
- üì¶ Thin adapter layer only
- üì¶ Swappable implementations

### Team & Quality

- Junior developers for adapter maintenance
- Minimal custom code
- Focus on integration, not implementation
- Keep adapters thin and technology-agnostic

### E-Commerce Generic Examples

| Subdomain | Module Path | Solution Strategy | Typical Solutions |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Email Delivery** | `mail-driver/` | SaaS adapter | Transactional email services |
| **Identity Provider** | `idp-adapter/` | SaaS/OSS integration | OAuth/OIDC providers, SSO solutions |
