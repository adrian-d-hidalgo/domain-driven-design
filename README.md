## Introduction

**Domain-Driven Design** is a software development approach that focuses on modeling complex business domains through deep collaboration between technical experts and domain experts. Introduced by Eric Evans in 2003 and refined by Vaughn Vernon in 2013, DDD provides both strategic and tactical tools to tackle complexity at the heart of software.

### The Philosophy

At its core, DDD recognizes that:

1. **The domain is paramount** - The business problem you're solving is more important than the technology you use
2. **Language matters** - The way we talk about the domain shapes how we model it
3. **Complexity is inevitable** - But it can be managed through careful boundaries and strategic design
4. **Collaboration is essential** - Developers and domain experts must speak the same language

### Core Principles

The foundation of DDD rests on four pillars:

1. **Ubiquitous Language**: A shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts, reflected directly in the code
2. **Bounded Contexts**: Explicit boundaries that define where a particular model applies
3. **Strategic Design**: A framework for classifying and prioritizing different parts of your domain
4. **Tactical Patterns**: Concrete building blocks (Entity, Value Object, Aggregate) for implementing domain models

### Why DDD Matters

Traditional software development often starts with database schema design or UI mockups. DDD flips this approach: **start with the business problem, model the domain deeply, and let technical decisions follow from domain understanding**.

This inversion is powerful for complex domains but adds overhead for simple applications. Understanding when to apply DDD is as important as understanding how.
